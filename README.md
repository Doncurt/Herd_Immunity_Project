## Final Project: Herd Immunity Simulation.

This is a project that shows off not only python file IO and objects as well as classes, It demonstrates good Python Practices
as well as running the program in a traditional terminal shell

## Running the program
Population Size: 100,000 Vacc_percentage: 90% Virus Name: Ebola Mortality Rate: 70% Basic Reproduction Number: 25% Initial Infected: 10

Then I would type python3 simulation.py 100000 0.90 Ebola 0.70 0.25 10 in the terminal.
